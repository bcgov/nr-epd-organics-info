# Scripts

This folder contains manual scripts that can be run by a developer.

### Running a script

To run any JavaScript file in this folder, simply navigate to this directory
on the command line, and run a script file using `node`.

For example: `node places.js`

### Places

The `places.js` script parses the `places.csv` file to extract the relevant
place names (and locations) and output them in json format. 
It will also print out details about how many places were extracted, the
output file size, and details about duplicate place names.
